### Random thoughts
* Use latest version of any program and keep your code updated to support latest version. I hate it when software has requirements of lower version latest version especially in python pip. You can keep the requirements higher than a certain version but don't keep it less than a certain version. If it bugs in new major release, update your code to fix it. Thats the way your program can improve. If you don't have time to keep on updating code, at least mention at which version it has been tested and works successfully.
* Drugs aren't very good for you but I believe it should be decriminalized or legalized.
